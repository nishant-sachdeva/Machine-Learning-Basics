1. a00t11c0 a22t11c0 a02t11c0 a20t11c0 a00t11c1 a22t11c1 a02t11c1 a20t11c1
2. a01t00c0 a01t11c0 a01t01c0 a01t02c0
3. For this question, open rollnumber_1.eval and rollnumber_2.eval; then copy paste the last table
4. o6 with probability 0.5, since both the cases are identical and in each case there are two o6, one o3 and one o5
5. Infinity. Number of policy trees obtained = 〖|A|〗^N where N =(|O|^T-1)/(|O|-1)  
   To get the value of T, check the last table in rollnumber_1.out and copy #trials. Then calculate
